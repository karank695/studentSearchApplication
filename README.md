**studentSearchApplication**
studentSearchApplication is a full-stack microservice-based application built with Spring Boot (backend) and React (frontend) that allows you to:
- Retrieve student data from a dummy JSON source
- Assign departments like ME, CS, or ECE
- Store user data in an in-memory H2 database
- Search/filter students by department or ID
- Log API activity using Kafka, through a custom LoggerService microservice\n
